			<aside>
				<p>I first became interested in the potential for small automation projects within a normal accounting function in 2019. Over the last few years of my career, I've encountered projects that were within the scope of my position, but outside of my skillset. So I set out to bridge that skill gap. That's how I ended up enrolling in the Dallas College Software Development degree program.
				<br><br>
				The degree covers all major foundational skills for a programmer. I chose python as my specialization, but have also developed c++, SQL, networking, and R/Rstudio/Quarto skills. 
				<br><br>
				This is unconventional, but looking back on my career, I can think of many past projects and monthly tasks that would have been greatly simplified if I had known then what I know now.

				<div class="desc">
				A playful yet technical R and Quarto project analyzing a Kaggle dataset of every Scooby-Doo episode and movie. Using tidyverse for data wrangling and ggplot2 for visualization, I identified which characters were “most likely” to experience certain events—like Daphne being kidnapped—by transforming, aggregating, and ranking event data. Presented in an interactive Quarto revealjs slide deck, this project demonstrates my ability to clean and reshape data, perform exploratory analysis, and create engaging, story-driven visualizations.
