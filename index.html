                Recent Reads That Rocked My World
            </h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Against the Grain by James C. Scott
					<button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleDetails(this)">▶</button>
						<p class="details">I've been fascinated by world history since I was a child, but this book inspired a fresh look at early-state formation throughout the world. Amongst many other topics, the author's discussion of the innovation of record-keeping (accounting) and it's necessity for the existance and development of early states is fascinating. A particularly poignant ancient quote (pg.164) admonishes "Be a scribe. It spares you from bearing hoe and mattock, so that you do not carry a basket. It sunders you from plying the oar and spares you torment, as you are not under many lords and numerous masters."
						<br><br>
						Scott corroborates the conclusions of other anthropologists. In 'The Invention of Tomorrow' (pg.39) the authors write "For centuries, accountants invented new symbols and went busily about teaching each other how to interpret and use them[...].What [was] just described, of course, is how the Sumerians invented writing." As an accounting and finance professional, I was delighted to discover that accounting (scribe) is probably the oldest profession in the world.
