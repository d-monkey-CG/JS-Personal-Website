                Recent Reads That Rocked My World
            	</h2>

				<li>Against the Grain by James C. Scott
					<button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleDetails(this)">▶</button>
						<p class="details">I've been fascinated by world history since I was a child, but this book inspired a fresh look at early-state formation throughout the world. Amongst many other topics, the author's discussion of the innovation of record-keeping (accounting) and it's necessity for the existance and development of early states is fascinating. A particularly poignant ancient quote (pg.164) admonishes "Be a scribe. It spares you from bearing hoe and mattock, so that you do not carry a basket. It sunders you from plying the oar and spares you torment, as you are not under many lords and numerous masters."
						<br><br>
						Scott corroborates the conclusions of other anthropologists. In 'The Invention of Tomorrow' (pg.39) the authors write "For centuries, accountants invented new symbols and went busily about teaching each other how to interpret and use them[...].What [was] just described, of course, is how the Sumerians invented writing." As an accounting and finance professional, I was delighted to discover that accounting (scribe) is probably the oldest profession in the world.

				<li>Why War? by Richard Overy
					<button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleDetails(this)">▶</button>
      				<p class="details">This book was recommended in the Foreign Affairs magazine books list. The author discusses all of the most commonly aknowledged reasons that explain why state and non-state actors engage in warfare. He covers subjects such as: biology, psychology, anthropology, ecology, resources, belief, power, and security. In the end, there is no one reason for why humans engage in war, in all instances the reasons are complex and multi-faceted. 
					<br><br>
					My favorite quote from the book sums up the complexity of human motivation to engage in conflict. "The chief difficulty in describing warfare as the consequence of material ambition is separating out the desire for gain from the other motives that prompt conflict. If for the regular soldiers and leaders, plunder was a necessary corollary of warfare, often the only means to maintain loyalty, the campaigns in which they fought might nevertheless be pricipally for political advantage, religious imperatives, or dynastic ambition, in which predation was a satisfying by-product, but not the product itself" (pg.140).

				</li>
				<li>The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien
					<button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleDetails(this)">▶</button>
      				<p class="details">This is one of those really famous books that is often assigned in high school and is part of the cultural lexicon. Recently, the book appeared in an episode of the new tv series Smoke; where the main antagonist's stepson's father gives it to his teenage son and tells him that it is a coming of age story. I'm not sure that I would describe it that way. To me it's a story about facing a reality that many of us never have any reason to see, much less understand.  
					<br><br>
					There are many forms of violence that create trauma for those who live through them. This book is fundamentally about what it's like to be in a situation where a human being is traumatized daily, so that it becomes their new normal, and what it's like to survive and escape. The author and many men like him grapple with survivor's guilt and the monumental challenge of assimilating with 'normal', 'polite' society after enduring inhumane conditions. 
					<br><br>
					My favorite quote: "Something had gone wrong. I'd come to this war a quiet, thoughtful sort of person, a college grad, Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude, all the credentials, but after seven months in the bush I realized that those high, civilized trappings had somehow been crushed under the weight of the simple daily realities. I'd turned mean inside. Even a little cruel at times. For all my education, all my fine liberal values, I now felt a deep coldness inside me, something dark and beyond reason. It's a hard thing to admit, even to myself, but I was capable of evil." (pg.190).

				<li>The Heat Will Kill You First by Jeff Goodell
					<button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleDetails(this)">▶</button>
      				<p class="details">I read a review of this book on the New York Times website and immediately added it to my reading list. I've been curious about global food security and its political impacts since early 2022, right before Russia invaded Ukraine and wheat prices soared. Goodell covers all of the most important consequences of extreme heat, but in Ch. 6, Magic Valley, he discusses the impact on food production and on farmers throughout the world. 
					<br><br>
					We know from history that when food becomes unaffordable it can destabilize societies and lead to conflict. The best recent example of this is the Arab Spring, but there are numerous historical precedents, including the French Revolution. In the United States the cost of living crisis is important enough that the current President, Donald Trump, campaigned on lowering grocery prices. A promise, which he has not kept <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/5441550-trump-promised-lower-grocery-prices-on-day-one-heres-what-happened/">(The Hill)</a>.
					<br><br>
					Goodell's words on this are fairly prescient and worth quoting: "Without enough food, there is only hunger, chaos, and violence. Malevolent rulers and dictators throughout history have known this and exploited it for their own ends."(pg.123).
